# DoubleZombies
True to the title. DoubleZombies is a simple Minecraft datapack that doubles the number of zombies every 5 minutes.

# WARNING!
Use on servers **at your own risk**. There is currently no way that the pack removes or limits any zombies, so it will keep doubling them as long as your server is on.
