# DoubleZombies
True to the title. DoubleZombies is a simple Minecraft datapack that doubles the number of zombies every 5 minutes.

# UPDATE!
[Issue #1](https://github.com/redpendrew/doublezombies/issues/1) has been patched! When the number of zombies reaches 120 or more, 75 zombies will be killed.
